Free Libre Open Source 5G Software Defined Radio  HDL Suite.
A 5G gNB O-RAN compatible PHY and 5G UE PHY for Software Defined Radio front ends such as the bladeRF. The PHYs modulate and demodulate New Radio (5G) radio signals directly on the FPGA of the radio front end. The gNB PHY coupled with an O-RAN compatible MAC allows the hosting radio front end to become a gNB modem. While the UE PHY plus Controlling Software transforms it into a handset.
